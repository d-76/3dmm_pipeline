The scripts in this directory are meant to be run inside the docker environment.
You shouldn't need to run these scripts directly, as they are called by the host scripts in the parent directory.
If you are not running inside the docker environment, these scripts can provide a blueprint for how to build and run the pix2face pipeline directly on your host machine.

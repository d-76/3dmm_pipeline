__Note:__ For a complete 3D face geometry estimation and rendering solution with documentation, see [pix2face](https://github.com/VisionSystemsInc/pix2face), which contains this repository as a submodule.

This project contains code related to estimation of 3D face shape from one or more unconstrained images.
The project is meant to be used mainly as a submodule of other, larger projects.
